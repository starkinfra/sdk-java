     * Organization object
     * <p>
     * The Organization object is an authentication entity for the SDK that
     * represents your entire Organization, being able to access any Workspace
     * underneath it and even create new Workspaces. Only a legal representative
     * of your organization can register or change the Organization credentials.
     * All requests to the Stark Infra API must be authenticated via an SDK user,
     * which must have been previously created at the Stark Infra website
     * [https://web.sandbox.starkinfra.com] or [https://web.starkinfra.com]
     * before you can use it in this SDK. Organizations may be passed as the user parameter on
     * each request or may be defined as the default user at the start (See README).
     * If you are accessing a specific Workspace using Organization credentials, you should
     * specify the workspace ID when building the Organization object or by request, using
     * the organization.set_workspace(workspace_id) method, which creates a copy of the organization
     * object with the altered workspace ID. If you are listing or creating new Workspaces, the
     * workspace_id should be null.
     * <p>
     * Parameters (required):
     * @param environment [string]: environment where the organization is being used. ex: "sandbox" or "production"
     * @param id [string]: unique id required to identify organization. ex: "5656565656565656"
     * @param privateKey [EllipticCurve.Organization()]: PEM string of the private key linked to the organization. ex: "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMFYwEAYHKoZIzj0CAQYFK4EEAAoDQgAEyTIHK6jYuik6ktM9FIF3yCEYzpLjO5X/\ntqDioGM+R2RyW0QEo+1DG8BrUf4UXHSvCjtQ0yLppygz23z0yPZYfw==\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
